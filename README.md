# myBRC User Portal

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/coldfront/badge/?version=latest)](https://coldfront.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

The myBRC User Portal is an access management system for Berkeley Research
Computing. It enables users to create or join projects, gain access to the
clusters managed by BRC, view the statuses of their requests and access, view
their allocation quotas and usages, and update personal information. It enables
administrators to handle these requests and manage users and projects. The
portal is built on top of ColdFront.

ColdFront is an open source resource allocation system designed to provide a
central portal for administration, reporting, and measuring scientific impact
of HPC resources. ColdFront was created to help HPC centers manage access to a
diverse set of resources across large groups of users and provide a rich set of
extensible meta data for comprehensive reporting. ColdFront is written in
Python and released under the GPLv3 license.

## Quick Install

1. ColdFront requires Python 3.6, memcached, and redis. 

### CentOS (7)

Install EPEL then install required packages:

```
sudo yum install epel-release
sudo yum install python36 python36-devel memcached redis

# Install SQLite >= 3.8.3 from source since it is absent from the CentOS software repositories
wget https://sqlite.org/2020/sqlite-autoconf-XXXXXXX.tar.gz
tar -xzf sqlite-autoconf-XXXXXXX
cd sqlite-autoconf-XXXXXXX
./configure
make
make install

#Check version
sqlite3 --version
``` 


### CentOS (8)

Install EPEL then install required packages:

```
sudo yum install epel-release
sudo yum install python36 python36-devel memcached redis
``` 

### Ubuntu (16.04)
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jonathonf/python-3.6
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3.6 python3.6-venv memcached redis-server
``` 

2. Clone ColdFront in a new directory and create a Python virtual environment for ColdFront
```
mkdir coldfront_app
cd coldfront_app
git clone https://github.com/ubccr/coldfront.git
python3.6 -mvenv venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment and install the required Python packages
```
source venv/bin/activate
cd coldfront
pip install wheel
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

4. Copy coldfront/config/local_settings.py.sample to coldfront/config/local_settings.py. 
```
cp coldfront/config/local_settings.py.sample coldfront/config/local_settings.py
```

5. Copy config/local_strings.py.sample to config/local_strings.py and update if desired. 
```
cp coldfront/config/local_strings.py.sample coldfront/config/local_strings.py
```

6. Run initial setup
```
python manage.py initial_setup
```

7. OPTIONAL: Add some test data
```
python manage.py load_test_data
```

8. Start development server
```
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

9. Point your browser to http://localhost:8000

You can log in as `admin` with password `test1234`. 
You can log in as a PI using username `cgray` with password `test1234`.
You can log in as another PI using username `sfoster` with password `test1234`.

Password for all users is also `test1234`.

### Additional myBRC Setup Steps

10. Run a command to create database objects needed for accounting.

```
python manage.py add_brc_accounting_defaults
```

## Vagrant VM Install

Alternatively, the application may be installed within a Vagrant VM, running
Scientific Linux 7. The VM is provisioned using an Ansible playbook similar to
the one used in production.

1. Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
2. Clone the repository.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ucb-rit/coldfront.git
   cd coldfront
   ```
3. Prevent Git from detecting changes to file permissions.
   ```
   git config core.fileMode false
   ```
4. Checkout the desired branch (probably `develop`).
5. Install vagrant-vbguest.
   ```
   vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
   ```
6. Create a `main.yml` file in the top-level of the repository. This is a file
of variables used by Ansible to configure the system.
   ```
   cp bootstrap/development/main.copyme main.yml
   ```
7. Customize `main.yml`. In particular, fill in the below variables. Note
that quotes should not be provided, except in the list variable.
   ```
   db_admin_passwd: password_here
   from_email: you@email.com
   admin_email: you@email.com
   request_approval_cc_list: ["you@email.com"]
   ```
8. Provision the VM. This should run the Ansible playbook. Expect this to take
a few minutes on the first run.
   ```
   vagrant up
   ```
9. SSH into the VM.
   ```
   vagrant ssh
   ```
10. On the host machine, navigate to `http://localhost:8880`, where the
application should be served.
11. Load test data or (TODO) load a backup of the production database.

### Miscellanea

#### Virtual Machine

- Once the VM has been provisioned the first time, starting and accessing it 
can be done with:
  ```
  vagrant up
  vagrant ssh
  ```

- To stop the VM, run:
  ```
  vagrant halt
  ```

- To re-provision the VM, run:
  ```
  vagrant provision
  ```

#### Environment

- The application is served via Apache, so any changes to the application
(excluding changes to templates) are not applied until Apache is restarted,
which can be done with:
  ```
  sudo service httpd restart
  ```
- The Ansible playbook can be run manually with:
  ```
  cd /vagrant/coldfront_app/coldfront
  # Assert that there is a properly-configured main.yml in the current directory.
  ansible-playbook bootstrap/development/playbook.yml
  ```
- Any custom Django settings can be applied by modifying `dev_settings.py`.
Note that running the Ansible playbook will overwrite these.
- It may be convenient to add the following to `/home/vagrant/.bashrc`:
  ```
  # Upon login, navigate to the ColdFront directory and source the virtual environment.
  cd /vagrant/coldfront_app/coldfront
  source /vagrant/coldfront_app/venv/bin/activate
  # Restart Apache with a keyword.
  alias reload="sudo service httpd restart"
  ```

#### Emails

- By default, emails are configured to be sent via SMTP on port 1025. If no
such server is running on that port, many operations will fail. To start a
server, start a separate SSH session (`vagrant ssh`), and run the below. All
emails will be outputted here for inspection.
  ```
  python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:1025
  ```

## Accessibility

The service should be accessible to people with disabilities.

In practice, when contributing to the code, ensure that changes do not cause
accessibility issues to be flagged by the
[tota11y](https://khan.github.io/tota11y/) tool. This will be considered
during the code review process.

## REST API

The service's REST API is located at `/api`.

### Getting a Token

Some endpoints require an authorization token, which can be retrieved:

1. From an API endpoint, using username and password (not recommended over
HTTP):<br><br>

   Make a `POST` request to `/api/api_token_auth/` with body:

   ```
   {
       "username": "username",
       "password": "password",
   }
   ```

   This will return a response containing the requested user's token. Note that
the token displayed below is not valid.

   ```
   {
       "token": "c99b5142a126796ff03454f475b0381736793a1f"
   }
   ```

2. For developers, from the Django shell:

   ```
   from coldfront.core.user.models import ExpiringToken
   from django.contrib.auth.models import User

   username = "username"
   user = User.objects.get(username=username)
   ExpiringToken.objects.create(user=user)
   ```

### Authorizing a Request

For those endpoints requiring an authorization token, it must be provided in
the request headers. Note that this is exposed when not using HTTPS.

```
{
    "Authorization": "Token c99b5142a126796ff03454f475b0381736793a1f",
}
```

#### cURL Example

```
curl --header "Authorization: Token c99b5142a126796ff03454f475b0381736793a1f" https://domain.tld/api/
```

### Limiting Write Access

Some methods (i.e., `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`) may only be accessible to
superusers. For these, the provided authorization token must belong to a user
with `is_superuser` set to `True`.

### Limiting Access by IP

Access to the API may be limited by IP range. This can be configured in
Ansible, via the `ip_range_with_api_access` variable.

## Deployments

Deployments and configuration management are handled by Ansible, located in
the `bootstrap/ansible` directory.

In particular, the Ansible playbook installs, enables, and configures
PostgreSQL, creates log files, installs Pip requirements, copies ColdFront
settings files, runs initial setup, migrates the database, collects static
files, creates WSGI files for Apache, and restarts Apache.

Note that there are some additional server setup steps that are not currently
captured in the Ansible playbook.

1. Create `main.yml`.

```
cp bootstrap/ansible/main.copyme main.yml
```

2. Modify `main.yml` depending on the current deployment.

3. Run the Ansible playbook as the `djangooperator` user defined in `main.yml`.

```
ansible-playbook bootstrap/ansible/setup_cf_mybrc.yml
```
