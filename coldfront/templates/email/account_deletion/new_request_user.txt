Dear {{ user_str }},

There is a new request to delete your cluster account with the following reason: {{ reason }}

The request will wait in a queue for {{ waiting_period }} days before system administrators process the request.

After the request is complete, you will be removed from any remaining projects. You will lose access to the clusters. Your data will be deleted off of the cluster.

Please note that while you are able to regain access to the cluster in the future and may rejoin projects, your data will not be recoverable after this request is completed. It is therefore important to move all data that your PI or group wishes to keep out of your personal cluster directories. These include your 'home' and 'scratch' directories.

While your request is queued for the next {{ waiting_period }} days, please confirm that your data is safe to delete here: {{ url }}. If you do not confirm, system administrators may delete your data before you have the chance to move it.

If this is a mistake, or you have any questions, please contact us at {{ center_help_email }}.

Thank you,
{{ signature }}
