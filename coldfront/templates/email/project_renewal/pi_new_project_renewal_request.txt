Dear {{ pi_str }},

A user ({{ requester_str }}) has made a request to renew your allowance under project {{ requested_project_name }} via the MyBRC User Portal.

You may view the details of the request here: {{ review_url }}.

If approved, you will become a PI on the project. The requesting user will become a manager and gain cluster access under the project's allowance.

If you would like to prevent this, or have any questions, please contact us at {{ support_email }}.

You already have a portal account and may log in here: {{ login_url }}

Thank you,
