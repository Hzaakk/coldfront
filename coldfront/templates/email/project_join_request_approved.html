Dear {{ user.first_name }} {{ user.last_name }},<br>
<br>
Your request to join Project {{ project_name }} has been approved by its managers. A request to get access to the project on the cluster has been generated, and will be processed by admins. Once access is set up, you will receive a message indicating that you can run jobs under this project.<br>
<br>
As you wait for your account to be processed and to get access to Savio, we strongly recommend that you see and familiarize yourself with our extensive Savio documentation here:<br>
<br>
https://docs-research-it.berkeley.edu/services/high-performance-computing/<br>
<br>
As you begin working on the Savio system, a lot of the questions that may come up are answered in the documentation.<br>
<br>
A good place to start (if you haven't already done so) would be to carefully read through our documentation on Getting An Account on Savio:<br>
<br>
https://docs-research-it.berkeley.edu/services/high-performance-computing/getting-account/<br>
<br>
and How To Get Help on Savio:<br>
<br>
https://docs-research-it.berkeley.edu/services/high-performance-computing/getting-help/<br>
<br>
https://docs-research-it.berkeley.edu/services/high-performance-computing/getting-help/good-help-requests/<br>
<br>
as well as Frequently Asked Questions:<br>
<br>
https://docs-research-it.berkeley.edu/services/high-performance-computing/getting-help/frequently-asked-questions<br>
<br>
We update the Savio documentation on a regular basis, so we encourage users to check back and consult the documentation frequently and often for additions and new content.<br>
<br>
Moreover, if you have suggestions for content to be added/included in our Savio documentation, please let us know.<br>
<br>
We also encourage Savio users to communicate and work with other Savio users in their labs or elsewhere when troubleshooting and debugging issues come up, as some of you are collaborating on the same projects and using the same software and software libraries, using the same or similar scripts, sharing the same data, etc.<br>
<br>
